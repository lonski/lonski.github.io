Recently I have implemented a neural network backpropagation algorithm. First I did it in C++, helping my friend. Then I got interested in it a little bit more and I rewrote it in Java. I thought about learning more about this topic and maybe made this network do something usable. Still, my wisdom about neural network is very little.

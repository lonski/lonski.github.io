Again, from the 1st of december [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) has started. Nice programming riddles, without too much math, with funny story.  Every day there is a new puzzle, each consisting of two parts. The second part remains hidden until first is solved. Sometimes it verifies how flexible was your solution for the first part ;-)

This year, I'm solvim them in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). I just started learning it. 
And my solutions are on [Github](https://github.com/lonski/AdventOfCode2017).

After Worducator and Kolourator I made a Numeducator. Another mini-game, this time for learning numbers. It consists of three different stages:

 - Ballons - pop balloons and downcount the number of them
 - Apples - harvest apples from tree to basket
 - Gummy bears - catch falling bears into the bowl

Additionaly I merged all those lol-games into one project, I called it *Edunomator*. I have one more idea left - a mini-game for learning and playing with shapes, but it waits for free slot of time to be developed. All those games are written quickly, and kinda non-proffesional, but I do not plan to maintain and develop them too much. They do the job and provide some value for my kid, and this is enough.

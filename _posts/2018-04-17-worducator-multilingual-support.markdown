I added support for other languages to Worducator.

Each language has its own configuration file containing files to names mappings (before the name of word was in the filename). Currently supported languages:

- Polish
- English

Here are the links for code and binary ready to use:

- APK: [https://github.com/lonski/worducator/releases](https://github.com/lonski/worducator/releases)

And here is new demo:

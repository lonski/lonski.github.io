My son, Czarek, was very interested with switches, fans and rotors laying around in my toolbox. Inspired by 'manipulation boards', seen on some meme site, I made him a toy:

![Czarko toy 1](/images/czarko_toy1.jpg){:width="250px"} 
![Czarko toy 2](/images/czarko_toy2.jpg){:width="250px"}

The magic of a rotating fan took him out.

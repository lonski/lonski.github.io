I wrote another educational mini-game for kids. Its goal is to teach colors and words. Additionaly it is more interactive - instead of just sliding and poiting, kid has to drag pencil with correct color to the object area. For now there is 10 colors and 10 animals to be colored.

Generating content requires more work here. All drawings are made by me, and I don't know how to draw, so it took me some time to make those figures.

Also multilanguage support is included - two languages are defined for now: english and polish.
